# Comp359\_Assign1

This is my first assignment for "Comp 359 - Design \& Analysis: Algorithms" with my partner Kartik



We were given the task of finding and ranking 10 sources covering the analysis and design of algorithms.

To find a direct comparison we decided to rank 10 courses from various universities all on the same subject. 



We ranked the 10 lectures sets using both and objective formula based on course metrics, and a subjective ranking based on our preferences in the way the content was displayed.
